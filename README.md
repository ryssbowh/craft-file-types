## File types plugin for Craft Cms

Drap and drop your extensions in file types, create new file types and extensions.  
Your types will become available to restrict in the Assets field, allowing more control on which files can be uploaded on each field.

Defining new extensions and types won't have any effect unless the extensions are allowed in the config. Either switch on "Allow all extensions" in this plugin's settings, or manually allow them in config/general.php, in the `allowedFileExtensions` key.
